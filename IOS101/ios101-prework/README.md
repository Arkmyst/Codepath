## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps.
- Example App: Instagram
  - Changing the background color of the messages screen
  - Deleting old messages

Favorite app #1 - Discord:
1. Feature to create a server and organize into various voice & text channels.
2. Feature to customize a user's profile i.e. banner, about me and profile picture.
3. Feature to integrate third-party applications and services such as server bots.

Favorite app #2 - Notion:
1. Feature to create and organize notes, documents, and information in a hierarchical structure.
2. Feature to collaborate with others in real-time on shared documents and projects.
3. Feature to use pre-designed templates or create templates based on any specific needs.

Favorite app #3 - Quizlet:
1. Feature to create digital flashcards with questions on one side and answers on the other.
2. Feature to share your flashcard sets with other people as well as explore sets created by other users.
3. Feature that makes it cross-platform so users can access Quizlet on multiple devices, including desktop (web), iOS, and Android.

Favorite app #4 - Spotify:
1. Feature to automatically to be recommended songs, via algorithm, that help to create and form playlists.
2. Feature to view lyrics of the song playing specifically word by word.
3. Feature that syncs data and allows it to be cross-platform accessible on multiple devices.

### APP PROPOSAL


My proposed app that I envision creating based on my current skills is perhaps beta version of an app centered around meal preparation and cooking. I've named it "Chef Quack," inspired by the rubber duck some programmers use when facing challenges. Essentially my app would attempt to seamlessly combines the convenience of meal planning with an intuitive cooking experience. The app would feature a database screen allowing users to input and view recipes. Another screen would host a pantry, initially established based on user input, which dynamically adjusts quantities based on selected recipes. Additionally, I plan to implement a grocery shopping cart feature that notifies users when they've chosen a recipe requiring more ingredients than currently available in their pantry. These functionalities resemble the ones I highlighted earlier, which I consider my preferred app (not literally, though). The capacity to take notes and establish an organized database is reminiscent of Notion, while the flashcard-style view aligns with the presentation found in Quizlet.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- My greatest challenge was being completely new Xcode and navigating it.
- My second challenge would have to be that I am learning Swift for the first time - that too alone.
- My third challenge would be that I have ideas I want to implement but I am not yet knowledgeable on how to accomplish it right now.
